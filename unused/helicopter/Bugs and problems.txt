Bugs and problems:

player is not attached to heli after restart of the game.

Rotation of entity in any direction don`t change yaw ( :get_yaw() - returns 0)

Using set_bone_position scale model to -1, but rotate as need

Also I can`t control any bone independently

It would be useful function "is_attached()" for entity




Done:

Craft recipe
Rotation
