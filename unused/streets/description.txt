With the StreetsMod, you can build your own realistic streets with arrows, lines, manholes and many more cool stuff. You don't need any additional mod, but it's recommended to have stairs (default), wool (default) and bucket (default) installed. It's easy for you to enable/disable certain parts of this mod because it's organised as a modpack, which you can configure in Minetest's Main Menu -> Configure.
