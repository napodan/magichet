Tool Mods

Tool Mods are Minetest modifications that add useful devices.

The aim of this mod is to make tools that are simple, powerful, and fast;
to be coherent, visually appealing, and as user friendly as possible.

--------------------------------------------------
Sledges

Sledges are basically like pickaxes that do additional digging
(when you break a block, it instantly mines out the 8 blocks perpendicular
to the direction the tool is used).

There are 3 types of sledges: stone, bronze and obsidian.
Stone is cheap, but is slow, brittle and cannot break very hard blocks.
Bronze is extremely fast but wears out relatively quickly.
Obsidian is not as fast as bronze, but it is very durable.

Condensed Cobblestone (C = cobble, gives you 3 Condensed Cobblestone):

Workbenches

Workbenches are extensions of your own personal crafting capabilities.
They provide guides, automation, and four additional crafting areas.
Consequently, they can also store up to 36 stacks of items.

(A workbench is like making a wooden pick, except that you are making a
couple of legs instead of one handle.)

When used, the workbench contains a list of items, a recipe, and one of
four workbench areas (A, B, C, and D). The list is on the left, the recipe 
is in the middle, and the workbench is on the right.

The list:

The list lets you find items by mod name, by a search pattern, or by the
selected item's usage. You can also see a list of previously selected items.

To see the recipe of a particular item, find it in the list and click on the
item's button in the list. That item then becomes the selected item.

To change the mod name, select the mod from the dropdown list and click
the "Mod" button.

To search for a particular item by name, type in part of the name in the
search field, then click the "Search" button. To clear the search field,
click the "x" button next to it.

To see a list of previously selected items, click the "^" button next to
the "x" button.

The recipe:

The recipe shows you how to make the selected item. In the grid below the
type box and the arrow buttons is the list of items you will need to make
the selected item.

The type box shows you how the item is made, either by "Craft" or "Cook".
For now, these buttons do nothing (other than show you how a particular
recipe works).

If you have Technic installed, the type can also be "Alloy", "Grind", 
"Comp", or "Extr" (which indicates that the recipe uses an alloy furnace,
a grinder, a compressor, or an extractor, respectively).

The arrow buttons next to the type box let you select alternative recipes
(if the selected item has more than one).

If the item is a list of groups, rather than a specific item, you will see
a button with the word "Group" on it. To see all the items that belong to
those groups, click that button. To return to the normal list, click the
"x" button (next to the search field).

To see how the selected item is used by other items, click the "Uses" button
under the recipe for the item (just above your inventory list). That button
then becomes "List" (which you can click to see the normal list again).

Next to the "Uses" button is the number of items the above recipe produces
(if more than one) followed by the item's description.

The workbench areas:

Above the usual crafting grid is a "+" button, a "+10" button, a "Make"
button, and a "Clear" button.

To add one set of recipe items to the crafting grid, select the item from
the list and then click the "+" button. To add ten sets of recipe items,
click the "+10" button. Note that these will only place as many items as
you can (from the items you have in your inventory).

To craft the item and place the result into your inventory, click the
"Make" button.

To move all the items from the workbench area into your inventory, click the
"Clear" button.

All of the above actions only take place on the selected area, which you can
change by clicking on one of the buttons below the crafting grid (either
"A", "B", "C", or "D".

Items in the crafting grids will remain there until you craft with them, and
the workbench areas do not interfere with each other.

The item to the right of the crafting grid is the preview item (the item you
will make if you decide to craft what is currently in the grid). You can take
that item, as well, but you cannot place anything in it.

Note that extraneous items left in the workbench or the preview window that
cannot be put in your inventory (because your inventory is full, for example)
will spill out into the world on top of your workbench.
