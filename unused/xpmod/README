xp mod
======

this is BETA software.
it has been tested on minetest version 0.4.7.

cloning this repository:

    git clone https://git.gitorious.org/minetest-xpmod/xp.git


HOW IT WORKS
------------

you will get experience points (xp) as you dig and build. to see how much xp
you have, type:

    /showxp

if you want to give a user extra xp, you could do it like this:

    /givexp somebody digging 100

you'll need the necessary privs for that command:

    /grant singleplayer givexp

when you get more xp, you gain levels. as your level gets higher, you will
obtain experium while you dig or build.

to craft an experium pick, use experium (E) and a mese pick (P):

    E E E
    - P -
    - - -

the pick digs about double the speed of the mese pick, and offers double drops
when digging certain items.
