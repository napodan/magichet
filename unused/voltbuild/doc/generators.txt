voltbuild:generator
In game description is Generator
Summary:
A generator that uses coal to generate electricty.
Place in coal to be burned into electricity and attach cable nodes to send the electricity to other machines.This will be the first type of generator you build

voltbuild:geothermal_generator
In game description is Geothermal Generator
Summary:
Generates electricity from lava nodes directly next to this machine.
More lava nodes surrounding it help generate electricity faster.

voltbuild:windmill
In game description is Windmill
Summary:
Generator that produces more electricity the higher it is.
Minimize the number of nodes anywhere near this generator for best electricity production.

voltbuild:solar_panel
In game description is Solar panel
Summary:
Machine that generates electricity when out in the sun.

voltbuild:nuclear_reactor
In game description is Nuclear Reactor
Summary:
A complicated DANGEROUS generator.
It requires a Reaction Chamber and uranium to start generating internal electricity, radiation, and blow up.
Sending out electricity from the machine also requires internal wiring in the design
Only electricity that reaches the bottom middle of the design will reach the outside
Read up on the individual nuclear parts to better understand managing and optimizing your nuclear reactor.

voltbuild:watermill
In game description is Watermill
Summary:
Generates electricity from water nodes near this machine.
More water nodes surrounding it help generate electricity faster.
