voltbuild:nuclear_reaction_chamber
In game description is Reaction Chamber
Summary:
Uses uranium to produce internal electricity, radiation, and stress.
All three of those must be managed within the design if you want electricity safely.

voltbuild:reactor_fan
In game description is Reactor Fan
Summary:
Slowly relieves internal stress from one square in the design.

voltbuild:shielded_reactor_wiring
In game description is Shielded Reactor Wiring
Summary:
Same as Reactor Wiring except prevents radiation from going through this square.

voltbuild:reactor_steam_gen
In game description is Reactor Steam Generator
Summary:
Takes a little heat from a square in the design and turns it into internal electricity.

voltbuild:reactor_wiring
In game description is Reactor Wiring
Summary:
Connect to nuclear parts that generate electricity or to other reactor wires.
Use reactor wires like this item to carry internal electricity to the
bottom middle of the design for electricity to leave the nuclear reactor.
For connecting to a Reaction Chamber, the Shielded Reactor Wiring is best.

voltbuild:radioactive_shielding
In game description is Radioactive Shielding
Summary:
Stops radiation from going through this square in the design
Radiation travels up, down, left, and right inside the design.
Any radiation that reaches the edges will start being released from the machine
The radiation that leaves the machine can hurt you within a certain distance.
Radiation slowly fades away when the uranium is removed from the machine.

voltbuild:casing
In game description is Reactor Heat Casing
Summary:
Prevents stress in the form of heat from passing through this square.
Stress travels left, right, and up inside the design.
Once stress reaches the edges of the design or builds up too much in one square,
it then starts affecting the machine and becomes visible on the stress bar.
