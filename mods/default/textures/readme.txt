If you have downloaded 1 or moreof my mods, you've probably noticed that there are no textures for new items/nodes.
That's because I'm too lazy and want to make you use my texturepack %)

Some textures for this TP were derived from the original Minetest texturepack.
Some were drawn from scratch.
Some were tweaked or redrawn to support different mods for Minetest/Freeminer.

Like the original MT textures, this one are licensed as follows:

The original (made by me too) can be found here: https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?id=4391
So far this texturepack supports to some extent (so don't expect this mod to change all textures from, say, mesecons) following mods:
 - 4air
 - 4items
 - beds
 - better_coal
 - bucket
 - carts
 - chests.0gb.us (partial)
 - creatures
 - default (from default of: MT, FM, MiniTest)
 - desert_uses
 - diamonds
 - door
 - dye
 - enchantment
 - farming (extended to be used with an upcoming farming mod by me)
 - fire
 - firestone
 - fishing
 - flint
 - flowers (partial)
 - gauges
 - hud & hunger (partial)
 - itest (partial)
 - mapp
 - mesecons (partial)
 - moreores
 - moretrees
 - nether
 - pyramids (partial)
 - shared_autoban
 - snow
 - tnt
 - trail
 - voltbuild (partial)
 - wool
 - xpanes


I may have missed something as well as not marked as partial some mods, though.
For the obvious reasons I can't make a single screenshot with all that stuff on one screen.
So, for now, take a look at the one below - it'll give you an impression of what to expect:
