SPECIALTIES
===========
Minetest/Freeminer mod to add an XP system to the game with a little bit of
useful "magic".

This version was modified by 4aiman, though you may haven't noticed it.
Anyway, I had:
 - disabled XP gain if you're a ghost;
 - added other stuff to make it compatible with "enchantment" mod;
 - make granted "fly" priv to expire after 80 sec;
 - disabled XP spamming by destroying your own buildings;
 - etc...
