Enchantment
===========

**License:** Until released CC BY-NC-SA (3.0)

 This mod adds enchantment! Yep, similar to that of Minecraft :)
 Yet, there are differences. This mod is dependent on either specialties or
 ghosts mod. The latter is prefered and it is ghosts that'll be used if both
 are installed.

 So, basics are the same - three enchantements with weird names and (pseudo)
 random cost. If there's only specialties - XP would be taken from the
 enchanter. If there's ghosts mod - you'll need to lay your hands on some
 ectoplazm.

 To get some descent enchantements you'll need to be lucky.
 Mechanics are well explained here: http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Enchanting

 Note:
 -----
 While enchantment is MC feature I'd like to have different names for stuff ;)


List of ecnhantments:
---------------------
Current version is indev, so some of below ones would be changed in order to
produce effects on entities too.

Names in brackets are MC counterparts' names.
Implementation may be different from what a minecrafter would expect.
